
About
=====
The SensorWebClient provides easy access to timeseries data stored within 
Sensor Observation Services (SOS). A station measuring the phenomenon of 
interest can easily be picked from a map, discovered by station's metadata. 
After a station has been chosen, the data can be loaded and displayed in 
the client as diagram for further investigation.

There is a Wiki page describing the Sensor Web Client in general and give
access points to more resources of interest:

Installation
============
Configure the sensorwebclient-build-example.properties file and build the
client from command line using Apache Maven. You can separate several 
configuration contexts by renaming (the <new-context> part) and saving it

  sensorwebclient-build-<new-context>.properties
  
into your ${user.home}-folder. Build your context dependent Client instance
by running  

  mvn clean install -P env-dev -Denv=<context>

For detailed installation and configuration explanation, please consult 
the Wiki page
