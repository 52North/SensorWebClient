		<h3>Subscribe to Events</h3>

		<p>On the left you can define and subscribe events for which you want to be notified. Once an event occured
			(regarding incoming measurements and their combinations) a notification alert is sent to the user's email address</p>

		<p>The following event types are defined:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Over-/Undershoot</li>
			<li>Sensorloss</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Events on historic data makes no sense. The following images shall explain exemplarily when exactly a
			timeseries will trigger what kind of event notification.</p>

		<h4>Over- and Undershoot</h4>
		<p>The timeseries where you defined an event subscription on will be checked regularly for new measurement data.
			If there is new observation data available it is check against the thresholds defined by the user. Depending on the
			current state of the eventing chain an event is triggered or not. If so the user will be notified.</p>
		<div>
			<img src="./img/sesClient/ses-alerts_overshoot_en.png" width="400px" alt="example_overshoot_alert">
		</div>
		<p>Timeseries are visualisations interpolated by discrete measurements. While monitoring a timeseries the point in
			time when a notification is triggered will be after the one of the real event which has happened.</p>

		<h4>Sensorloss</h4>
		<p>The monitored timeseries will be regularly checked for new measurements. If there are no measurements within
			the checked time interval a sensorloss event is being triggered. A subscriber gets notified. After new measurements
			are available again another notification is being sent.</p>
		<div>
			<img src="./img/sesClient/ses-alerts_sensorloss_en.png" width="400px" alt="example_sensorloss_alert">
		</div>
		<p>In extreme cases (e.g. when a user picks a time interval of an hour) the event notification may be deferred up
			to twice as the given interval, as the last considered time interval contains one measurement value at the beginning.
