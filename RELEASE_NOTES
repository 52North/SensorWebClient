Release Notes for Sensor Web Client 3.2.0
=========================================
This release contains new features and bugfixes from versions 3.1.x. 

Most work has been done to create a leightweight RESTful interface to access 
timeseries data and metadata from external clients (not only from shipped UI).
A modularization of the UI and its server part has been done to run a server 
only application to just provide a SOS aggregation layer.

Features:
---------
 * Add REST API to parameters, stations, timeseries raw data and metadata
 * Add style options to permalink so that graphs of one permalink renders in same color and line width
 * Removed local repository from root pom.xml as all old dependencies are available from 52n repo now
 * Change Metadata structure, now stations in the metadata have a collection of parameter collections
 * RESTful interface expanded and option added to request metadata specific to an SOS (see https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/SensorWeb/RESTfulTimeseriesWebApp)

3.1.x Bugfixes:
---------------
 * #923: Stations from the first data provider are missing when starting client via Permalink
 * #924: Timeseries values are not sorted when request timeseries data via GET
 * #877: Starting the Sensor Web Client from a Permalink the Station Selector misses to show up all stations
 * #875: First time opening profile/user window an error occurs
