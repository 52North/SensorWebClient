Release Notes for Sensor Web Client 3.3.0
=========================================
This release contains new features and bugfixes from versions 3.2.x. 

Most work has been done to create specify and implement a version 1 for the
leightweight RESTful interface. Accessing timeseries data and metadata from 
external clients (not only from shipped UI) is now more consistent and more 
flexible. Configure your servlet container with a CORS filter and provide 
the data to external clients.

Another part of the work was to modulerazing IO processing functionality to 
an external timeseries module. In combination with the timeseries web module 
provides an interface so that both can be re-used in other applications, e.g.
directly on an SOS with implementing the interface with DB access to speed 
up things.
