Release Notes for Sensor Web Client 3.3.0
=========================================
This release contains new features and bugfixes from versions 3.2.x. 

We moved from SVN to GitHub with this release! Please note that issues are  
going to be tracked on that platform. Refer to

  https://github.com/52North/SensorWebClient

Most work has been done to separate timeseries-api version 1.0.0 along with
implementing its service provider interface to provide leightweight RESTful 
access to timeseries resources. That integration makes accessing timeseries 
data and metadata from external clients (not only from shipped UI) much more 
consistent and flexible! Configure your servlet container with a CORS filter 
and provide the data to external clients.

Another part of the work was to modulerazing IO processing functionality to 
an external timeseries module. In combination with the timeseries web module 
provides an interface so that both can be re-used in other applications, e.g.
directly on an SOS with implementing the interface with DB access to speed 
up things.
